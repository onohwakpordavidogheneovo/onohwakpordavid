      <h4>OUR DOCTRINAL BELIEFS</h4>
      <div class="line1"></div>
      <p>
        <b>The Apostle's Doctrine</b><br>

        "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third <br>
        day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all <br>
        nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses of these things. And, behold, I send <br>
        the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued <br>
        with power from on high" (Luke 24:46-49).<br><br>
        
        ​
        
        <b>Pentecost: What's That?</b><br>
        
        The day of Pentecost was observed in Jerusalem fifty days after the celebration of the <br>
        Passover, which commemorated Israel's deliverance out of Egypt. It is significant that this <br>
        day was chosen by the Lord to begin the fulfillment of Joel 2:28: "I will pour out my Spirit <br>
        upon all flesh...."<br><br>
        
        ​
        
        <b>Questions on the Godhead</b><br>
        
        Is the word trinity in the Bible? No.<br>
        Does the Bible say that there are three persons in the Godhead? No.<br>
        Does the Bible speak of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost? Yes.<br>
        
        ​
        
        What Is Sin? this question is of vital importance because of the fearful judgment against <br>
        those who commit sin. "The soul that sinneth, it shall die," thunders the Old Testament <br>
        (Ezekiel 18:20). In like tones, the New Testament declares: "The wages of sin is death" <br>
        (Romans 6:23). The one who lives in sin throughout his earthly life and faces God without <br>
        having obtained divine forgiveness will be sentenced to eternal perdition.<br><br>
        
        ​
        
        <b>Except Ye Repent</b><br>
        
        The three words of this title come from Luke 13:5, which reads, "Except ye repent, ye shall all <br>
        likewise perish". Plainly, then, the tragic alternative to repentance is eternal perdition. In view <br>
        of this fact, it is extremely important that everyone knows what repentance is and how it is <br>
        accomplished. <br><br>
        
        ​
        
        <b>Why We Baptize in Jesus' Name</b><br>
        
        The subject of water baptism has long been called a great issue and no doubt has been <br>
        made such by many church leaders of the past and present. In our study of it, let us first <br>
        consider its importance, or the necessity of being baptized.<br><br>
        
        ​
        
        <b>The Gift of the Holy Ghost</b><br>
        
        The gift of the Holy Spirit has become the topic of much discussion in our day. Men and <br>
        women of all persuasions and from all walks of life have become interested enough to <br>
        search for greater understanding of this phenomenal spiritual experience. Capturing <br>
        headlines, dominating the content of many religious periodicals, and generally creating <br>
        excitement, this canon of apostolic faith deserves a sincere appraisal.<br><br>
        
        ​
        
        <b>Why Did God Choose Tongues?</b><br>
        
        He was a deacon in a fashionable church, but he did not believe in the Pentecostal doctrine <br>
        relative to the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Yet he had been exposed to that belief through <br>
        members of his immediate family. One night, at the close of an Evangelistic service in an <br>
        Apostolic church, he went forward to pray and was overwhelmingly filled with the Spirit of <br>
        God. He spoke in other tongues fluently and was so inundated in the Spirit that even hours <br>
        later he could not speak English. Definitely, this was a biblical experience accompanied not <br>
        only by speaking in another tongue, but also by the joy and peace of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>
        
        ​
        
        <b>After Death: What?</b><br>
        
        Can anyone think of a more relevant question? All of us pass through the narrow <br>
        passageway leading from this life to the next-the passageway we call death. We shall all <br>
        experience the transition into a new realm, another existence beyond this life and world we <br>
        know today.<br><br>
        
        ​
        
        <b>Divine Healing</b><br>
        
        God is the Great Physician. His knowledge of the human mind and body is complete. <br>
        He can do more for the sick and the diseased than can all earthly doctors and surgeons combined.<br>
        He created us; is it not reasonable, then, to believe that He can heal us when we are sick?<br><br>
        

        <b>The Scriptures Decree Modesty in Dress</b><br>
        
        In ancient times, as throughout many countries today, a person's social rank could be <br>
        determined by his dress. Similarly, dress is a significant measurement of Christian conduct <br>
        and practice. Christians can often by identified as such by their outward appearance.<br><br>
